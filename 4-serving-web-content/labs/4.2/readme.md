The following code creates a stream with a built in delay when the stream function is called:

```javascript
function stream() {
  const readable = Readable.from(
    ["this", "is", "a", "stream", "of", "data"].map((s) => s + "<br>")
  );
  const delay = new Transform({
    transform(chunk, enc, cb) {
      setTimeout(cb, 500, null, chunk);
    },
  });
  return readable.pipe(delay);
}
```

Using either Fastify or Express, create a new route at path /data and send the data from this stream to the response when the /data route is requested.
